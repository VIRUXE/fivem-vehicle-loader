# Addon Vehicle loader

This resource finds all the vehicles by their folder name, processes the name and adds vehicle names to the game.

## Usage
Folder syntax: `brand-model_name`
Example: `apollo-intensa_emozione`

You should create one folder for the `.meta` (the files that set the vehicle's properties) files and another with the exact same syntax inside the stream folder, where you will store your `.yft` and `.ytd` files.
This resource needs to find the `.yft` file in order to get the game name.
